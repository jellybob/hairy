<h1>Choose Jon's Haircut</h1>

<section class="intro">
  <p>In an attempt to raise some money for East to West I foolishly said that I was going to
  shave my head. And then I doubled down on that, and said that if the donations got to £250
  then I'd let people choose my hairstyle.</p>
  <p>Well... they got to £250 (currently they're at <%= number_to_currency(@total, unit: "£") %>). Hooray.</p>
  <p>Below are 5 hairstyles, all of which I'd really rather not be wearing for the next month. Pick my poison. And donate more money!</p>
