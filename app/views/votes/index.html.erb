<h1>Choose Jon's Haircut</h1>

<p>In an attempt to raise some money for East to West I foolishly said that I was going to
shave my head. And then I doubled down on that, and said that if the donations got to £250
then I'd let people choose my hairstyle.</p>
<p>Well... they got to £250. Hooray.</p>
<p>Below are 5 hairstyles, all of which I'd really rather not be wearing for the next month. Pick my poison. And donate more money!</p>
